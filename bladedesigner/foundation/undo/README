Undo Framework for Python
=========================

This is an undo/redo framework based on a functional approach which uses
a undoable stack to track actions.  Actions are the result of a function
call and know how to undo and redo themselves, assuming that any objects
they act on will always be in the same state before and after the action
occurs respectively.  The `Stack` tracks all actions which can be done
or undone.
