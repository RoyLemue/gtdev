USER MANUAL


Introduction
------------

Gas Turbine Developer a.k.a gtdev is an open source tool which assists the engineer in 
developing a new gas turbine (1D Thermo- and Aerodynamics). It is created by the 
student research group "Hummingbird - TUM Gas Turbines" placed at the LFA, TU Munich.

How to install
--------------

gtdev is written in python and works therefore on every machine where python is installed.
However it has been tested extensively only on Linux.
The following python modules have to be installed before the program can be run:
- numpy
- scipy
- PyQt4
- ConfigParser
- bladedesigner (included)
- Pickle
- dautil
    - IPython
    - pandas

How to use
----------

For input either the GUI can be used by executing

python gtdev.py

or the provided classes may be used directly in so called project-scripts, which are unique for 
every machine. In this script the boundary conditions of the configuration are defined.
An example of this kind of script can be found in the projects/-folder. To use this,
just execute

python gtdev.py --file=<path/to/your/file


Getting into it
---------------

gtdev uses the object orientated approach to compute the turbomachine, that means every part
of the machine (e.g. compressor, turbine) is defined in a single independend class.
These components or "objects" are combined and supervised in a configuration class (e.g. turbofan, turbojet),
which determines how the single components work together.
The advantage of this design is the easy expansion of the program to different configurations.
The classes can be used and modified with just basic programming skills.


GUI
---

If the in- or output-values of any component are not fully visible, please change the size of the gtdev-window (only the use of the 
scrollbar will not be sufficient).
